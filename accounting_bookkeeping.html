                    <h4>Property Tax Return</h4>
                    <p>
                        Since all personal property taxes are state imposed, each jurisdiction may include different types of property in the tax assessment. 
                        Additionally, these taxes are often imposed by local governments, such as cities and counties, making the rules even less uniform across the country. 
                        Each state, or even each local jurisdiction such as a county, will have its own specific form you must fill out to report your personal property tax. <br><br>

                        If you end up paying personal property taxes to your local government, the IRS allows you to claim a deduction for it on your federal tax return. 
                        However, the IRS requires you to satisfy certain requirements, regardless of how your government classifies the tax. <br><br>

                        Clare Accounting Group will identify your personal property tax requirements and file the annual property tax return if deemed necessary
                        to ensure that you or your business is able to claim a deduction for the property tax you have paid. <br><br>

                        For an annual fee Clare Accounting Group can file your property tax return. <br>
